# 🧠 11th Computer Science Practicals – C++ (Tamil Nadu Board)

This repository contains all the **11th Standard Computer Science practical programs** rewritten, improved, and restructured by **Srisuban**.  
The code is designed to be **clean, readable, and fully functional**, mainly using **VS Code**, with a few built and tested in **Visual Studio**.

## 🚀 About the Project

These programs are based on the **Tamil Nadu State Board (Class 11) Computer Science syllabus**.  
I’ve **edited, reformatted, and optimized** the original practical codes to:
- Improve readability and structure  
- Fix small logic or syntax issues  
- Provide clearer input/output for easier learning
