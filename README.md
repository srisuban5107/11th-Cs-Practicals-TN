## 🚀 About the Project

These programs are based on the **Tamil Nadu State Board (Class 11) Computer Science syllabus**.  
I’ve **edited, reformatted, and optimized** the original practical codes to:
- Improve readability  
- Fix minor logic or syntax issues  
- Enhance input/output style for modern C++ standards
